**Sustainable Tourism Monitoring: A Deep Learning Approach For Corals' Classification Using Vision Transformers (ViT)üåç**
## **Problem Statement**  
Tourism plays a crucial role in global economies, but unsustainable tourism practices contribute to environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and pollution. Identifying and monitoring **sustainable vs. unsustainable tourism activities** is essential to promoting responsible tourism and protecting natural ecosystems.  

## **Agitate**  
Manual monitoring of tourism-related environmental impacts is **time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often inconsistent**. With **increasing tourist activities worldwide**, it is challenging to track areas affected by **over-tourism, pollution, or ecological damage**. Conservationists and policymakers need **an automated, scalable solution** to assess tourism's impact on the environment efficiently.  

## **Solution**  
A **Vision Transformer (ViT)** can be trained on an image dataset depicting **sustainable and unsustainable tourism practices**. The model can classify images based on environmental impact, aiding in monitoring tourist destinations.  

## **Explanation of Modifications and Dataset Relevance**  

### **Dataset Selection**  
- I searched for a **relevant dataset** related to **sustainable tourism**, including images of **overcrowded tourist spots, pollution in natural areas, and eco-friendly tourism initiatives**.  
- The dataset contains labeled images of **Bleached_Corals** and **Healthy_Corals** that allow the model to **distinguish between sustainable and unsustainable tourism practices**.  
- This dataset is essential for training a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** to automate the classification of tourism-related environmental impacts.  

### **Notebook Modifications**  

- **Data Processing:** I structured the dataset into **healthy corals** and **bleached corals** categories, ensuring a proper **train-test split** for model evaluation.  
- **Feature Extraction:** I utilized **Vision Transformer (ViT)** to extract meaningful features from coral reef images.  
- **Model Training:** Implemented a **neural network classifier** on the extracted features to differentiate between **healthy and bleached corals**.  
- **Regularization Techniques:** To improve generalization and reduce overfitting, I applied **data augmentation** and **dropout layers** in the model.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The model was assessed using **loss curves, confusion matrix, and accuracy scores** to ensure its effectiveness.  

### **Results & Insights**  

- The **confusion matrix** and **accuracy scores** demonstrated that the model successfully differentiates between healthy and bleached corals.  
- **Loss curves** indicated that regularization techniques like **dropout and data augmentation** effectively mitigated overfitting.  
- The **model‚Äôs predictions** provide valuable insights for conservation efforts and highlight tourism‚Äôs impact on marine ecosystems.  

### **Relevance to Sustainable Tourism**  
‚úÖ **Environmental Impact Assessment:** The model helps authorities track and manage the effects of tourism on ecosystems.  
‚úÖ **Policy Support:** By providing automated insights, it assists policymakers in making **data-driven decisions** for responsible tourism management.  
‚úÖ **Public Awareness:** The model educates travelers on **sustainable tourism** by highlighting the consequences of **harmful practices**.  

### **Alignment with SDGs**  
üîπ **SDG 14 (Life Below Water):** The model supports efforts to **protect marine biodiversity**, particularly coral reefs affected by unsustainable tourism.  
üîπ **SDG 15 (Life on Land):** Encourages responsible tourism practices that **minimize environmental degradation** on land-based ecosystems.  

This project contributes to global sustainability goals by integrating **AI-driven monitoring** for **sustainable tourism practices**. üåç
