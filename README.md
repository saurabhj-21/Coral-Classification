**Sustainable Tourism Monitoring: A Deep Learning Approach For Corals' Classification Using Vision Transformers (ViT)üåç**
## **Problem Statement**  
Tourism plays a crucial role in global economies, but unsustainable tourism practices contribute to environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and pollution. Identifying and monitoring **sustainable vs. unsustainable tourism activities** is essential to promoting responsible tourism and protecting natural ecosystems.  

## **Agitate**  
Manual monitoring of tourism-related environmental impacts is **time-consuming, resource-intensive, and often inconsistent**. With **increasing tourist activities worldwide**, it is challenging to track areas affected by **over-tourism, pollution, or ecological damage**. Conservationists and policymakers need **an automated, scalable solution** to assess tourism's impact on the environment efficiently.  

## **Solution**  
A **Vision Transformer (ViT) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** can be trained on an image dataset depicting **sustainable and unsustainable tourism practices**. The model can classify images based on environmental impact, aiding in monitoring tourist destinations.  

## **Explanation of Modifications and Dataset Relevance**  

### **Dataset Selection**  
- I searched for a **relevant dataset** related to **sustainable tourism**, including images of **overcrowded tourist spots, pollution in natural areas, and eco-friendly tourism initiatives**.  
- The dataset contains labeled images that allow the model to **distinguish between sustainable and unsustainable tourism practices**.  
- This dataset is essential for training a **Vision Transformer (ViT) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automate the classification of tourism-related environmental impacts.  

### **Model Adaptation**  
- Instead of identifying **coral bleaching**, the model is now trained to **detect sustainable and unsustainable tourism activities**.  
- Adjustments were made to the **input pipeline, preprocessing steps, and data augmentation** to align with the new dataset.  

### **Relevance to Sustainable Tourism**  
‚úÖ **Environmental Impact Assessment:** The model helps authorities track and manage the effects of tourism on ecosystems.  
‚úÖ **Policy Support:** By providing automated insights, it assists policymakers in making **data-driven decisions** for responsible tourism management.  
‚úÖ **Public Awareness:** The model educates travelers on **sustainable tourism** by highlighting the consequences of **harmful practices**.  

These modifications ensure that the project aligns with **SDG 14 (Life Below Water)** and **SDG 15 (Life on Land)** by promoting **responsible tourism and environmental conservation**. üåç
